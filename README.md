# Neural-Network-using-Numpy
Introduction to Neural Networks (Create a neural network using Numpy)

In this assignment, you will build a complete neural network using Numpy. You willÂ implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc.

You will use the MNIST dataset to train your model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.

The assignment is divided into the following sections:

-   Data preparation
-   Feedforward
-   Loss computation
-   Backpropagation
-   Parameter updates
-   Model training and predictions

For Ipython notebook: (Refer to Neural-Networks-using-Numpy.ipynb file)

For  the dataset: (Refer to mnist.pkl.gz file)
